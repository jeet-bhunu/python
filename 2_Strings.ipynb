    "  <li>Use the appropriate string type for your needs (e.g. use <code style=\"color: #800000;\">'</code> for string literals, use <code style=\"color: #800000;\">\"</code> for HTML attributes).</li>\n",
    "  <li>Avoid using the <code style=\"color: #800000;\">+</code> operator to concatenate strings in a loop. Instead, use the <code style=\"color: #800000;\">join()</code> method for better performance. <span style=\"color: #FFD700;\">🚀</span></li>\n",
